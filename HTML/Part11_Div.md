# HTML Div
In HTML, the `<div>` tag is a versatile and commonly used element that provides a way to group and organize other elements within a web page. The `<div>` tag itself does not carry any semantic meaning, but it serves as a container or a division that helps structure the content.

In this topic, we will explore how to use the `<div>` tag for general grouping and organization within HTML documents.

## Using the `<div>` tag
The `<div>` tag is represented by `<div>``</div>` and is usually placed around a group of related elements.

Here's an **example** of using the `<div>` tag to group elements:
```https
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>HTML Div Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div>
	<h2>Section Title</h2>
	<p>Paragraph of text.</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>List item 1</li>
	  <li>List item 2</li>
	  <li>List item 3</li>
	</ul>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

In the example above, the `<div>` element contains a heading (`<h2>`), a paragraph (`<p>`), and an unordered list (`<ul>`) with list items (`<li>`).

## Benefit of Using `<div>` for Grouping and Organization
**Structural Organization**: The `<div>` tag helps to structure and organize the content within your HTML document. By grouping related elements, you can create logical sections or blocks that are easier to understand and maintain.
