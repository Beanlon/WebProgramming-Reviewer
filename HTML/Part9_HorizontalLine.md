# HTML Horizontal Line
The `<hr>` tag in HTML is used to insert a horizontal line, also known as a "horizontal rule," on a webpage. It is a self-closing tag, meaning it does not require a closing tag. Horizontal lines can be used to visually separate sections of content, or create a visual break.

## Inserting a Horizontal Line
To insert a horizontal line using the `<hr>` tag, simply include the tag in your HTML code. Here's an example:

```https
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is more text.</p>
```
In this example, a horizontal line is inserted between two paragraphs of text. When rendered in a browser, the line will extend across the width of its containing element.

## Inserting a Horizontal Line
Here is a diagram illustrating the placement and appearance of the horizontal line:

#### Example
```https
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>HTML Horizontal Line Example</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>This is some text.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>This is more text.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```
#### Output

## This is some text with a horizontal line.
## This is another text with another horizontal line.
