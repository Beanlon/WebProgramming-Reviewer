# Attributes
HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.

* All HTML elements can have **attributes**
* Attributes provide **additional information** about elements
* Attributes are always specified in the **start tag**
* Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: **name="value"**

## The href attribute / LINK
The `<a>` tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:

#### Example
```https
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>
```

## The src attribute / image
The `<img>` tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:

#### Example
```https
<img src="img_girl.jpg">
```

## Alt attribute
The required alt attribute for the `<img>` tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.

#### Example
```https
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">
```
