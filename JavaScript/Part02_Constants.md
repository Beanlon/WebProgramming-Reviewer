# Constants
Constants are numerical value that are not allowed to be changed and cannot be changed when given another value

Constants are created when typing in `const` instead of let in the actual variables 

#### Example
```https
const PI = 3.14159;

PI = 420.69 //Console error
```

This will create a console error since again Constant values cannot be changed was they have already been declared
